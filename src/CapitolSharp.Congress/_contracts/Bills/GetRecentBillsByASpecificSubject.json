The GAO review must examine  the extent to which DHS tracks data and monitors trends related to trusted traveler programs; whether DHS coordinates with the heads of other relevant federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial entities regarding redress procedures for disqualifying offenses not covered by its own redress processes but that may impact an individual's enrollment in a trusted traveler program; how DHS may improve access to reconsideration procedures regarding a disqualifying offense for enrollment in a trusted traveler program that requires the involvement of other federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial entities; and the extent to which travelers are informed about reconsideration procedures regarding enrollment in a trusted traveler program.
